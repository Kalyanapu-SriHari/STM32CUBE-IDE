# Embedded Systems Learning Repository
 
**Welcome! This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in Embedded Systems, starting with the STM32 microcontroller platform.**

## Goals

* Gain hands-on experience with embedded programming.
* Understand STM32 architecture, peripherals, and development tools.
* Build and test simple to advanced embedded applications.

## Topics Covered

* STM32 hardware setup and toolchain configuration
* GPIO, UART, Timers, ADC, and other peripheral programming
* Bare-metal and HAL-based development
* Memory management and interrupt handling
* Real-time concepts and debugging techniques

## Tools & Environment

* STM32CubeIDE 
* Stm32f103c8t6
* C programming language
* Open-source debugging and flashing tools

* This is a work-in-progress repository meant for personal growth, experimentation, and documentation.
